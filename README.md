# My very first Web Page

Welcome!

This Project is my first website using github.

Tools/assets used:
HTML5
HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of webpage content by implementing a markup based pattern to it. 

CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.

Git
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

Github
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

The rationale behind this project:
It will be used as the basis for future projects.
